          Hepatitis B is an infectious disease affecting the liver caused by the
          Hepatitis B Virus (HBV).This virus has disproportionately affected
          Asian American and more specifically Chinese American communities in
          North America.

          <h2>About HBV</h2>
          <p>
            Hepatitis B is an infectious disease affecting the liver caused by
            the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). HBV can cause either an acute or
            chronic infection of Hepatitis B. While many individuals do not
            immediately develop symptoms upon contracting the virus, acute
            symptoms that can last up to several weeks include yellowing of the
            skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea,
            vomiting and abdominal pain (1). In a small percentage of
            individuals, the disease can progress to the chronic phase, causing
            liver cirrhosis (scarring), liver cancer, or acute liver failure,
            all of which can lead to death (1). In 2010, about 786,000 deaths
            could be attributed to hepatitis B: 132,200 due to acute hepatitis B
            liver failure, 341,400 due to hepatitis B-caused liver cancer,
            312,400 due to cirrhosis induced by hepatitis B (2). The World
            Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the number of deaths due to
            hepatitis B has increased to 887,000 in 2015 (1). The numbers
            indicate the severity of hepatitis B and the importance that the
            world must place on this major global health problem. One recent
            study indicates that the current prevalence of worldwide acute
            hepatitis B is around 168 million while the prevalence of global
            chronic hepatitis B infection is close to 400 million cases (3).
            These numbers include carriers of the disease who have HBV but do
            not exhibit symptoms. While acute infection of hepatitis B in adults
            leads to chronic hepatitis B in less than 5% of cases, acute
            infection of hepatitis B in infants and young children leads to
            chronic hepatitis B in around 95% of cases (1). HBV is transmitted
            via blood or semen through processes such as sexual contact,
            intravenous contact, and perinatally from infected mother to neonate
            (4). While there are treatments for chronic hepatitis, there remains
            no cure. These treatments are frequently long-term to suppress the
            effects of chronic hepatitis B. There are currently 7 approved
            treatments for hepatitis B (5). Despite there being no cure, an
            effective vaccine has been available since the 1980s (6).
            Post-exposure prophylaxis, the prevention of infection after
            exposure, is also possible with the vaccine or a combination of
            hepatitis B vaccination and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (5). This
            process is effective, safe, and indicated in many possible routes of
            HBV exposure, including for newborns born to hepatitis B positive
            mothers, sexual exposure, or after liver transplantation (6).

          <h2>HBV and the Chinese American Community</h2>
          <p>
            Prevalence of chronic HBV varies greatly across countries. Prior to
            the expansion of the vaccine, the World Health Organization
            categorized 37 countries, including China, into the Western Pacific
            Region, which was disproportionately impacted by hepatitis B;
            despite having 28% of the world’s population, this region accounted
            for over 50% of all deaths caused by hepatitis B (7). In 1992, a
            large national survey of over 61,000 Chinese citizens found that
            9.75% of subjects tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen
            (HBsAg), an indicator for positive hepatitis B infection (8).
            Despite the demonstrable effect of the hepatitis B vaccine, HBV
            still remains a big issue in Chinese American communities today. One
            study conducted in Chicago’s Chinatown found HBV prevalence in 11.1%
            of patients presenting for general medical care.(9) Various studies
            conducted of Chinese-speaking and Chinese immigrant populations
            across North America have found that screening rates vary between
            33% - 57% and vaccination rates are between 31% - 38% (10–12). It is
            crucial to visit your doctor or a suitable clinic to be tested and
            vaccinated. Please check our “Useful Links” page to see locations
            where you and your children can be screened and vaccinated.
